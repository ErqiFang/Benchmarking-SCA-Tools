# sbom-benchmark
SBOM benchmark for different metadata-based SBOM tools. This benchmark includes manually crafted metadata files and ground truth datasets for common languages.

We try to cover all supported syntaxes for each language and hope the benchmark can steer the development of more robust SBOM generators.
